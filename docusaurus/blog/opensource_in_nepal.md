# Open Source in Nepal üåè

Open Source is more than just free software ‚Äî it is a movement built on collaboration, transparency, and community. Around the world, open-source projects power the internet, businesses, and daily life. But what about Nepal? How has open source shaped our tech journey, and where are we heading next?

## A Short History of Open Source in Nepal

Open-source adoption in Nepal began with small communities of enthusiasts. Groups like **GNOME Nepal**, **FOSS Nepal Community** and the **Linux Users Group Nepal** played a key role in introducing Linux and free software to students and professionals. Early meetups and workshops created the foundation for today‚Äôs open-source culture.

## The Current State

Today, open source is everywhere in Nepal. Students, startups, and IT professionals use tools like:

- **Linux distributions** for servers and desktops  
- **GNOME** as a desktop environment for productivity  
- **LibreOffice** for documents and spreadsheets  
- **Python, PHP, and JavaScript frameworks** for software development  

Communities such as **FOSS Nepal, Mozilla Nepal, Python Nepal, and GNOME Nepal** continue to organize events, share knowledge, and mentor new contributors. Universities and colleges are also slowly encouraging students to explore open-source technologies.

## Opportunities & Impact

Open source offers Nepal many advantages:

- **Cost Savings** ‚Üí Students and businesses avoid expensive proprietary software.  
- **Global Opportunities** ‚Üí Contributions to projects like GNOME, Mozilla, or Linux connect Nepali developers to international networks.  
- **Innovation** ‚Üí Open source allows Nepali startups to build faster using proven technologies.  

For young developers, open source is also a pathway to **learning, freelancing, and global recognition**.

## Challenges We Face

Despite the progress, there are hurdles:

- Limited awareness among students and non-tech communities  
- Lack of mentorship and guidance for new contributors  
- Funding and infrastructure issues in universities and startups  
- Over-reliance on pirated proprietary software  

These challenges slow down adoption, but they also highlight the areas where we can work together as a community.

## The Role of GNOME Nepal

**GNOME Nepal** is one of the communities actively working to promote open source. Some of our contributions include:

- **Localization** ‚Üí Making GNOME available in the Nepali language  
- **Events** ‚Üí Hosting meetups, workshops, and conferences like **Ubucon Asia 2025**  
- **Community building** ‚Üí Creating spaces for students and professionals to learn, share, and contribute  

By bringing GNOME closer to Nepali users, we hope to inspire the next generation of open-source contributors.
